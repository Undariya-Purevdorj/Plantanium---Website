# Plantanium---Website
An online platform designed to bring users from all around the world together and let them connect with each other and share their personal insights when it comes to animals and plants.
We used React, HTML, and CSS for the front end, express.js, and node.js for the backend, Auth0 for authentication, and MongoDB for the database.
