Plantanium
New owners of household creatures have a hard time learning how to care for them. Plantanium has just the right solution to help you along your journey with your new buddy!

Inspiration
My family is notorious for killing plants in such little time after they arrive at our house. It's hard to know the conditions and amount of food/water your little creature needs which is why we created this website to help new and experienced owners connect.

What it does
It's a website that allows users to register accounts and the companions they have with them. In addition, they can search through all the users to find specific species that they are thinking about and talk with the owners to gain more insight.

How we built it
We used React, HTML, and CSS for the front end, express.js, and node.js for the backend, Auth0 for authentication, and MongoDB for the database.

Challenges we ran into
As this was our first time using a database, we found it hard to learn the querying techniques that were needed to carry out our tasks. In addition, user interaction and getting input was also an issue as there were many cases that broke our program and we had to fix it.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We completed an autocomplete search on our database and a robust website that was fully operational. In addition, we were able to use authentication that separated user-profiles and customization.

What we learned
We learned how to use databases and connect them with React Apps. It was also a great learning opportunity to further our knowledge in javascript as most of us were usually back-end developers. This hackathon was also all of our first in-person hackathons and it taught us how much fun they really are.

What's next for Plantanium
Some next steps would be to implement a live chat on the websites and geological/weather data. These could help the website become more useful and help new owners get an even better grasp on how to take care of their new friends.
